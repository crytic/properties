/// @notice This contract has two purposes:
///  1. Act as a proxy for performing vault deposits/withdraws (since we don't have vm.prank)
///  2. Keep track of how much the account has deposited/withdrawn & raise an error if the account can withdraw/redeem more than it deposited/minted.
/// @dev It's important that other property tests never send tokens/shares to the Actor contract address, or else the accounting will break. This restriction is enforced in restrictAddressToThirdParties()
///      If support is added for "harvesting" a vault during property tests, the accounting logic here needs to be updated to reflect cases where an actor can withdraw more than they deposited.
